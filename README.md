# Welcome to the FOWL Clan Demonlist!

### How do I add a completion to the list?

- In the FOWL Clan Central discord server, there is a channel called fowl-list-submissions.
  In that channel, you will have to upload a youtube video of the completion. We will then
  add your completion to the list.
